# 2048 Game – C Project

This academic project was developed as part of the “Introduction to Programming Systems” course (Afeka College, 2025).  
The goal of the assignment was to implement the classic 2048 game in C using pointers, modular design, and a flexible game board size.

The program represents the 2048 game board as a one-dimensional array managed with pointers, without using global variables or static arrays.  
It supports dynamic board sizes, random tile generation, and player interactions using keyboard input (U/D/L/R for moves, N for new game, E for exit).

## Features
- Full 2048 game logic implemented in C  
- Dynamic board size (M×M) and configurable winning score  
- Pointer-based memory management (no static arrays)  
- Supports multiple games per run and flexible restart options  
- Strict adherence to clean code, modular functions, and Makefile requirements

## Technologies
- C language  
- Linux / Ubuntu environment  
- Makefile build system  
- Terminal-based interaction

## Notes
The code compiles and runs in a standard Ubuntu environment using:
